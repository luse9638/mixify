Mixify is a website that you can log into with your Spotify account. It works communally, so multiple people need to log into it. It stores everyone’s 100 most listened to songs collected from the Spotify api-in a database. Then, you can put in your username and up to 9 other people’s username in and see all the songs that everyone has in common - or the songs that the greatest number of people have in common with the count of people who have it if there’s no one song everyone has in common.
