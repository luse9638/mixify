This is final group project for CSCI 3308 Fall 2022 at the University of Colorado Boulder.

Mixify is a website that you can log into with your Spotify account. When you log in, tt stores your 100 most listened to songs collected from the Spotify api in a database. Then, you can add a friend that has also logged in and see all the songs that you both have in common.

Tech Stack Used:

Prerequisites to run application:
You need to have a spotify account in order to log in to the website. Additionally, you'll get a better experience if you actually use your spotify account. You'll also need to email luke.sellmayer@colorado.edu and include the email address associated with your spotify account. This allows us to add you to the authorized users list so you'll actually be able to log in.

How to run application locally:
1) Make sure docker is installed and running.
2) Navigate to the /ProjectCode/ directory
3) Run ```docker-compose up``` in your terminal
4) Visit localhost:3000 once the message "listening on port 3000" displays in the terminal.
5) To shutdown, run ```docker-compose down --volumes```

How to run tests: n/a

Link to deployed application: we were unable to deploy the application due to technicaly issues with the server.
